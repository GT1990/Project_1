## Motivation

The motivation for completing Project_1 is to be graded and recieve feedback on my javascript development. I also plan on adding this project to my portfolio to use later on as I apply for jobs.

## Built with

HTML
CSS
JAVASCRIPT

## How to use?

The functionality of this application is fairly simple. Clicking on the "Show another quote" button on the top right of the page will display a different random quote or just let the quote change automatically every 10 seconds.

## Credits

The HTML & CSS of this project was created by the Treehouse Techdegree team. The javascript file is where most of my work would be found.
